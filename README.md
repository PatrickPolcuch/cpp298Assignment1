Problem 2 takes 2 command line parameters. The first is the room capacity and second the amount of people.
Problem 3 takes 1 command line parameter. The hours the employee worked a week.

The Assignment
So now that you know how to compile and run C++ programs within a Linux (Docker) environment, let’s
keep driving home the basics of the language. Your assignment is to implement the following
programming projects:
Problem 1 (cereal):
A metric ton is 35,273.92 ounces. Write a program that will read the weight (console input) of a package
of breakfast cereal in ounces and output the weight in metric tons as well as the number of boxes needed
to yield one metric ton of cereal.
Problem 2 (firecapacity):
Write a program that determines whether a meeting room is in violation of fire law regulations regarding
the maximum room capacity. The program will read in the maximum room capacity and the number of
people to attend the meeting. If the number of people is less than or equal to the maximum room capacity,
the program announces that it is legal to hold the meeting and tells how many additional people may
legally attend. If the number of people exceeds the maximum room capacity, the program announces that
the meeting cannot be held as planned due to fire regulations and tells how many people must be excluded
in order to meet the fire regulations.
Problem 3 (employeepay):
An employee is paid at a rate of $16.00 per hour for regular hours worked in a week. Any hours over that
are paid at the overtime rate of one and one-half times that. From the worker’s gross pay, 6% is withheld
for Social Security tax, 14% is withheld for federal income tax, 5% is withheld for state income tax, and
$10 per week is withheld for medical insurance. Write a program that will read in the number of hours
worked in a week as input and that will then output the worker’s gross pay, each withholding amount, and
the net take-home pay for the week.
For each problem you will implement one source file (.cpp) using the following naming convention,
ProblemX.cpp where X is the name in parenthesis. For this assignment you may implement all code in the
main method of each program. This is a poor practice that we will soon remedy once you have a bit more
C++ experience.
So your deliverables are 3.cpp files and a README.
A README is a text file that includes your name, student id # and any references you used for the
assignment.
